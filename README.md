## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Why Kubernetes?

When The applications grow in complexity, managing them manually becomes challenging. Containers can help by packaging applications and their dependencies, but orchestrating hundreds or thousands of containers requires automation. Kubernetes solves this by:

- **Cluster**: Stored all container In Kubernetes instead of on a single Host.
- **Automating deployment and scaling**: Easily roll out new versions, scale up or down based on yours container demand.
- **Auto healing**: whenever The container is goes down Kubernetes will start a New container Automatically, restarts failed containers and replaces them if needed.
- **Service discovery and load balancing**: Exposes containers using DNS names or IP addresses and distributes traffic.
- **Efficient resource utilization**: Schedules containers based on available resources.
